## Slides

- [Why Do We Visualize?](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/WhyWeVisualize.pdf)
- [What is D3.js? / When should I use it?](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/whatIsD3.pdf)

## Ok, Let's get coding!

## Exercise: [Make the same bar plot in three different ways!]() TKTK link

In these exercises you will be making the same bar plot in three different ways: 

- Using HTML, CSS, and SVG
- Using D3.js
- Using D3 AND data joins

## Exercise: [Building our first scatter plot]() TKTK link

We'll now build our first full chart by plotting one of the Ambscombe data sets in a scatter plot.
