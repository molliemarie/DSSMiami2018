## Demo

Those who are able to fire up a local server should do so in order to follow along. Additionally, I will also be posting code into [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=zFIttuCoBx). Join to access code as it is updated.

Finished example will be located here (link to be added after workshop). Data used in the demo is included in the [data directory](/data).
